# Automated Inventory System

## Layouts

### Splash Screen

The Splash Screen of the autoCommerce application acts a hub that allows one to access the other poritions of the program. The Splash Screen showcases a slick design which has its own customized taskbar. The taskbar consits of three options, a custom Close button, which closes the applcation normally but sports a nice and clean design. The Minimize button serves a similar function as it replaces the standard minimize with a cleaner nicer looking button. The last button on the new taskbar is the Login button which opens the Login pages where users are able to make sure they are using their account to save their data. All of this is accompanied by a custom splash art which adds charm to the splash page. The most important function of the Splash Screen is the launch button which closes the Splash Screen but sends the user to the application with the account of their choosing.
