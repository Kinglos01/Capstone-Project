# Automated Inventory System

## Layouts

### Splash Screen

The Splash Screen of the autoCommerce application acts a hub that allows one to access the other poritions of the program. The Splash Screen showcases a slick design which has its own customized taskbar. The taskbar consits of three options, a custom Close button, which closes the applcation normally but sports a nice and clean design. The Minimize button serves a similar function as it replaces the standard minimize with a cleaner nicer looking button. The last button on the new taskbar is the Login button which opens the Login pages where users are able to make sure they are using their account to save their data. All of this is accompanied by a custom splash art which adds charm to the splash page. The most important function of the Splash Screen is the launch button which closes the Splash Screen but sends the user to the application with the account of their choosing.

### Login Screen

The Login Screen of the autoCommerce application is a standard login screen for an application. The login screen has a refreshing design with its own customized taskbar. The taskbar like consists only of a close button but with a cleaner more refreshing design. The Login Screen has three required textfields which represent the user's "username," "email," and "password." The login screen has two buttons other then the taskbar, the Log in button and the Register button. The Log in button exactly as stated it logs it checks the email, username and password of the user and checks them against the users entered into the database. If the user is not in the database, the log in will be rejected and the user will stay on the Log in screen with an error message displayed. If the user is already located within the database the user will be logged in and sent back to the Splash Screen. The other button on the Log in screen is the register button. The button appears as a text label saying "Create an Account Here." When clicked on the Login will be closed and the Register screen will be opened in its place.
